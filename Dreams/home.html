    <h1> Role Model</h1>
    <span>There are many reasons to look up to Kendrick Lamar,<br>
     but one of the main reasons is because of how much <br>
     I can relate to him as a person, and how much he's <br>
     accomplished despite the obstacles placed in front <br>
     of him. He raps not for the money, but because it <br>
     is his passion and writing helps him destress, just<br>
     as writing down what I'm thinking does to me. <br>
     He speaks with plenty of wisdom, which is rare for <br>
     someone his age to have. When he talks, almost all <br>
     the things he says get me thinking about life. He's<br> 
     always emphasizing hard work gets you to where you <br> 
     want to go. Despite his current status, he stays <br>
     humble and is constantly seeking self improvement. <br>
